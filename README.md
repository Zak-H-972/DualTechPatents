## Proof of Concept

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax
for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on
using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that
includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code
chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

``` r
summary(cars)
```

The full<br>mesh distributed switchless system allows direct<br>and indirect communication between a source node<br>and a destination node.

The<br>traffic can be divided into all available links<br>across the nodes, rather than only the links<br>connecting the source and destination nodes.<br>Because indirect communication uses more links<br>compared to direct communication, the traffic in<br>each link is smaller.
